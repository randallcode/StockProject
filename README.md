# StockProject
Project website to show skills learned after taking the first half of Code Kentucky Bootcamp. Related to stocks / 401K / investing. I will create all the necessary coding files for a webpage, including: the HTML file, the CSS file, and the Javascript file. These files will contain all the coding that controls the functionality and layout of the main page. Concepts learned through the Web Development Section 1 course will be the main focus.

Features I intend to include:

    Feature 1: A responsive menu using CSS, with it being designed as "Mobile First".
    Feature 2: A transition of an element on hover.
    Feature 3: A score of 60 or better when running PageSpeed Insights from google.com.
    Feature 4: A simple hide/show div using CSS.
